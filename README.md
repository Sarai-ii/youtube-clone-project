## Accessibility
>
In addition to making this app accessible to as many
users as possible, our secondary goal includes being in
compliance with the American with Disabilities Act,
the Canadian Standard on Web Accessibility, and
guidelines stemming from the EU Web Accessibility
Directive, which are set to be enforcable by June 28, 2025.
>
In this case, we focused on color contrasting, appropriate
labeling of navigation tags, and language.
>
Style guidelines were taken from the Human Interface
Guideslines from Apple.
